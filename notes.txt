The token end point URL is https://developer.gm.com/oauth/access_token

The client application needs to request and obtain the token from this
endpoint by adding the following parameters using the
“application/x-www-form-urlencoded” format in the HTTP request body:

grant_type – REQUIRED, must be set to “client_credentials”

Confidential clients or other clients issued client credentials MUST
authenticate with the authorization server. Clients in possession of a client
password must use the HTTP Basic authentication scheme as defined in [RFC2617]
to authenticate with the authorization server. The client identifier is used
as the username, and the client password is used as the password.
i.e. Authorization:BasicczZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW

The client can choose to receive the response in either JSON, or XML by
specifying the Accept HTTP
header.
